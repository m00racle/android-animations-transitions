# Android Animations and Transitions
These are the full project files for the album cover app used in Treehouse's Animations and Transitions course.

NOTE:

I make some changes in the Gradle version to 3.0.1 to accomodate the Google() repo for implementations of dependencies. 
Then I also change sme code in the AlbumDetailActivity.java to adapting the latest butter knife libraries. Other than 
that I have not found any errors so far.
